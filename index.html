    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I’m Ryan Price, an African American from Baltimore, Maryland. Born in Harbor Hospital and raised in the Cherry Hill Projects with my grandmother, I first got the idea of a business plan from her. At eight, I moved with my mom to Gwynn Oak, but my ties to Cherry Hill remained strong. My primary goal growing up was to make money, though I didn’t see much wealth around me. My father became a role model when he started his business when i was 12, teaching me about the stock market and the value of working smart. My mom’s dedication to hard work also influenced me deeply. Now, inspired by both of them, I’m determined to start a trucking company to travel the world and become the most financially successful person in my family.</p>
